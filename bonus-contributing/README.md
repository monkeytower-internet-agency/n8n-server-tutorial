## B.3 Understanding GitHub Issues

### What is an Issue?

**An "Issue" is like a discussion thread or task ticket.** Think of it as:

- **A bug report:** "I found an error on page X"
- **A feature request:** "Please add a chapter about Y"
- **A question:** "I'm stuck at step Z, can you help?"
- **A suggestion:** "This could be clearer if..."

**Issues are the primary way open source projects communicate and track work.**

### How Issues Work

1. **Someone creates an issue** describing a problem or idea
2. **The community discusses** the issue - asking questions, sharing ideas
3. **Labels are added** to categorize the issue (bug, enhancement, question, etc.)
4. **Work happens** - either the maintainer fixes it, or contributors help
5. **Issue gets closed** when resolved

**Issues stay open until the problem is solved or the discussion concludes.**

### Issue States

- **Open:** Active discussion or work in progress
- **Closed:** Resolved, completed, or no longer relevant
- **Locked:** Discussion ended (usually for off-topic or resolved issues)

## B.4 Creating Your First Issue

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Find the Tutorial Repository

1. **Go to [github.com/monkeytower-internet-agency/n8n-server-tutorial](https://github.com/monkeytower-internet-agency/n8n-server-tutorial)**
2. **Click the "Issues" tab** (next to "Code", "Pull requests", etc.)

#### 2. Create a New Issue

1. **Click the green "New issue" button**
2. **Choose the appropriate issue type:**
   - **Bug report:** For errors, broken links, incorrect commands
   - **Feature request:** For new content or improvements
   - **Question:** For help or clarification
   - **Blank issue:** For anything else

#### 3. Write a Clear Title

**Good titles are specific and descriptive:**
- ✅ "Broken link in Chapter 3: Podman installation"
- ✅ "Add chapter about monitoring N8N workflows"
- ❌ "Help needed"
- ❌ "This doesn't work"

#### 4. Write a Detailed Description

**Include these elements:**

**For Bug Reports:**
```
What I was trying to do: [brief description]
What I expected: [expected behavior]
What actually happened: [actual behavior]
Steps to reproduce: [numbered steps]
System info: [Ubuntu version, Podman version, etc.]
```

**For Feature Requests:**
```
Current situation: [how it works now]
Proposed improvement: [what should change]
Why this matters: [benefit to users]
Alternatives considered: [other solutions you thought of]
```

Specific question: [clear, focused question]
What I've tried: [steps you've already taken]
```

#### 5. Add Labels (Optional)

**Labels help categorize issues:**
- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `enhancement` - New feature or improvement
- `documentation` - Documentation issue
- `question` - Help needed
- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers

#### 6. Submit and Follow Up

1. **Click "Submit new issue"**
2. **Watch the issue** for responses
3. **Respond to questions** from maintainers
4. **Update with new information** if needed

## B.5 Issue Etiquette and Best Practices

### Be Respectful and Constructive

- **Use friendly language** - remember people volunteer their time
- **Be specific** - vague issues are hard to fix
- **Do your research first** - check if the issue already exists
- **Stay on topic** - one issue per problem/feature
- **Say thank you** - appreciate the work done

### Before Creating an Issue

**Search existing issues:**
1. Use the search bar in the Issues tab
2. Check closed issues too - they might have solutions
3. Look for similar problems or requests

**Check the documentation:**
- Re-read relevant chapters
- Check the troubleshooting sections
- Look at the README for common questions

### What NOT to Do

- **Don't demand fixes** - politely request help
- **Don't spam** - one issue per problem
- **Don't be rude** - maintainers are volunteers
- **Don't expect instant responses** - open source has varying response times

---

## B.6 Following Up on Issues

### Staying Engaged

**After creating an issue:**

1. **Watch for responses** - GitHub will email you
2. **Answer questions** promptly and completely
3. **Test solutions** when provided
4. **Mark as resolved** when your issue is fixed

### Helping Others

**Once you're comfortable with issues, you can:**

- **Answer questions** from other users
- **Test bug fixes** and report results
- **Suggest solutions** for problems you know how to solve
- **Review and comment** on feature requests
